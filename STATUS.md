## Current Scope

0.1.0 makes Vesicle a credible direct API host for Prism Engine, not just a
Chat wrapper:

- Load engine profiles from `assets/engines/*.yaml` and drive systemPrompt,
  tool surface, validators, and stop gates from them at runtime.
- Run a terminal UI with provider status, markdown-rendered message stream,
  responsive workspace/artifact sidebar, wide-screen activity/artifact pane,
  slash hints, prompt history recall, and input bar.
- Call an OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions endpoint.
- Load multiple OpenAI-compatible provider/model profiles from the user-level
  provider config (`%APPDATA%\prism-vesicle\providers.yaml` on Windows,
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/prism-vesicle/providers.yaml` or
  `~/.config/prism-vesicle/providers.yaml` elsewhere); the TUI can list and
  switch provider/model during a session. Provider files name `apiKeyEnv`
  variables only; actual secrets stay in the same user-level directory's
  `.env` file, with process environment variables used only as fallback.
- Configure low-frequency model defaults in `providers.yaml` object model
  entries: `generation.temperature`, `generation.maxTokens`, and capability
  metadata for display and future protocol gating. String model entries remain
  supported.
- Control thinking behavior for subsequent TUI turns with
  `/think off|low|midium|high|xhigh|max`; `/think auto` clears the explicit
  choice. Unset sessions preserve the provider/model default instead of
  sending control fields.
- Show provider `reasoning_content` as a separate TUI thinking block before
  assistant text, with `/reasoning hidden|collapsed|expanded`; the default
  collapsed mode keeps long reasoning bounded to a short tail preview.
- Persist sessions as JSONL under `.vesicle/sessions/`; resume them through a
  TUI picker, including unresolved `request_confirmation` gates.
- Execute a file-tool loop (`list_files` / `read_file` / `write_file`) with a
  high ceiling and a no-progress circuit breaker instead of a coding-agent
  hard cap.
- Pause the workflow on `request_confirmation` gates; the user confirms,
  revises, or retreats to chat, then the loop continues.
- Validate artifact-shaped ETL output against Module A (character card) and
  Module B (scenario card) v9 schemas; ordinary prose replies are not reported
  as schema failures.
- List, preview, validate, and revise generated artifacts through TUI commands
  that operate on actual files in the artifact roots.
- Dump the fully composed system prompt via `vesicle prompt dump --engine <id>`
  for host-pollution auditing.

The Prism asset lineage comes from the public sibling repository
[`3aKHP/Neural-Narratology`](https://github.com/3aKHP/Neural-Narratology).

## Tool Surface

| Tool | Status | Write scope |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `list_files` | Implemented | Read-only |
| `read_file` | Implemented | Read-only |
| `write_file` | Implemented | `workspace/`, `test_runs/`, `novels/`, `reports/` |
| `request_confirmation` | Implemented (gate) | No filesystem access |
| `config.load` | Internal contract | N/A |
| `prompt.load` | Internal contract | N/A |
| `session.write` | Internal contract | `.vesicle/sessions/` |

All model-visible filesystem paths are project-relative. Absolute paths and
`..` escapes are rejected. The `request_confirmation` tool is only attached to
a turn when the active engine profile declares at least one stop gate.

## Gate Runtime

| Gate | Engine | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `blueprint-confirmation` | etl | Wired (Phase 0) |
| `phase-confirmation` | etl | Wired (Phase artifact checkpoints) |
| `runtime-turn` | runtime | Declared in profile, runtime-ready |

Engines with empty `stopGates` never offer `request_confirmation`, so their
models cannot invoke a gate the host would then have to refuse.

## Validators

| Validator | Engine | Checks |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| `character-card` | etl | Module A v9: frontmatter allowlist, seven sections, Persona Topology subsections, axis counts, L-System leakage |
| `scenario-card` | etl | Module B v9: 3–5 beat map, per-beat fields, tension range, trajectory, legacy field rejection |

Validator failures are advisory — they surface in the TUI and session log but
never abort a turn. Validators run only on artifact-shaped assistant content
(YAML-frontmatter documents), not on ordinary phase-transition prose.

## Known Limits

- Only OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions is implemented (Anthropic Messages,
  OpenAI Responses, Gemini are deferred).
- The provider registry supports multiple configured providers, but all
  configured providers must currently use the `openai-chat-compatible`
  protocol. Native Anthropic Messages, Gemini, and OpenAI Responses adapters are
  deferred.
- OpenAI-compatible SSE streaming is implemented on the 0.2 branch for
  assistant content deltas and streamed tool-call reconstruction. Other
  provider protocols are still deferred.
- Thinking-tier control maps to OpenAI-compatible `thinking` and
  `reasoning_effort` request fields. User-visible reasoning is currently a TUI
  display feature for preserved OpenAI-compatible `reasoning_content`; native
  Anthropic, Gemini, and OpenAI Responses thinking surfaces are deferred with
  their provider adapters.
- TUI engine switching is hardcoded to ETL (runtime/evaluate profiles exist
  and load, but the TUI does not yet offer a selector).
- Gate UI is Select-style for ETL blueprint and phase checkpoints, with a
  dedicated bottom confirmation panel. Workflow B hook selection may still need
  a more specialized selector later.
- MCP and Skills are directory stubs, not runtime integrations.
- Long-form engines (Weaver / Weaver-Orch / Dyad) have profiles and prompts
  but no dedicated validators or gate wiring.
- Prompt-cache engineering (PrefixShape hashing, CacheDiagnostics) is deferred.

## Verification

Current standard checks:

```powershell
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run doctor
```

The `tests/e2e-gate.test.ts` suite runs against the real provider when the
selected provider's `apiKeyEnv` is present through the user-level `.env` file
or process environment; it returns early otherwise.
